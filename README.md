# sals-shipping-exercise

This exercise is an exercise found in the Codecademy Python course. The goal of the program is to determine which shipping method is the cheapest option based on the package weight. I will be moving in stages here and I wanted to keep track of my progression throughout which is why I am choosing to upload this small assignment to my GitHub profile.
